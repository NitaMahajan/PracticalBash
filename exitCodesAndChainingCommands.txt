Practical Bash and Terminal Skills

Part 1: Exit codes and Chaining commands

--------------------
Exit codes
--------------------

Take a command
>> echo "Hello World"
>> Hello World

Every command has an exit code
To have a look at exit code

>> echo $?
>> 0

0 means success exit code
Non 0 means failed exit code (usually 1, 127 etc)

Try doing cat on a non existent file
>> cat non-existent-file.txt
>> cat: non-existent-file.txt: No such file or directory

and then
>> echo $?
>> 1 
This time the command exit code is 1 meaning it failed


--------------------
Chaining Commands
--------------------
1. Using ; semicolon
>> echo "foo"; echo "bar"
>> foo
>> bar

; will execute both commands irrespective of exit code

>> cat non-existent-file.txt; echo "bar"
>> cat: non-existent-file.txt: No such file or directory
>> bar

2. Using && command
>> cat non-existent-file.txt; echo "bar"
>> cat: non-existent-file.txt: No such file or directory

&& command will execute the next command only if the previous command has success (0) exit code

3. Using || command
>> echo "foo" || echo "bar"
>> foo

|| command will execute the second command if the first has fail exit code

>> cat non-existent-file.txt || echo "bar"
>> bar
